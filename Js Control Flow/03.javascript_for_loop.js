//In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.

//For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then you can use a loop. 
//It's just a simple example; you can achieve much more with loops.
//This tutorial focuses on JavaScript for loop. You will learn about the other type of loops in the upcoming tutorials.


//The syntax of the for loop is:

//for (initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
    // for loop body
//}

//Here,
//1. The initialExpression initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once.
//2. The condition is evaluated.
//If the condition is false, the for loop is terminated.
//If the condition is true, the block of code inside of the for loop body is executed.
//3. The updateExpression updates the value of initialExpression when the condition is true.
//4. The condition is evaluated again. This process continues until the condition is false.
