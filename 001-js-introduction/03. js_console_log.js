//<h1>JavaScript console.log()<h1>
//In this tutorial, you will learn about JavaScript console with the help of examples.

//<h2>JavaScript console.log()</h2>
//All modern browsers have a web console for debugging. The console.log() method is used to write messages to these consoles. For example,

let sum = 44;
console.log(sum);   // 44

//When you run the above code, 44 is printed on the console.

//<h2>console.log() Syntax</h2>
//Its syntax is:

console.log(message);
//Here, the message refers to either a variable or a value.

//Note: We will be using the console.log() method to display the output in our upcoming lessons.

//<h3>Example 1: Print a Sentence</h3>
// program to print a sentence

// passing string
console.log("I love JS");

//Output: I love JS

//<h3>Example 2: Print Values Stored in Variables</h3>
// program to print variables values

// storing values
const greet = 'Hello';
const name = 'Jack';

console.log(greet + ' ' + name);

//Output: Hello Jack

//As you can see from these examples, console.log() makes it easier to see the value inside a variable. That's why it's commonly used for testing/debugging code.

//The console object also has various methods other than console.log(). To learn more, visit JavaScript console.
