//JavaScript Regex
/*In JavaScript, 
a Regular Expression (RegEx) is an object 
that describes a sequence of characters 
used for defining a search pattern. For example,*/

/^a...s$/

/*The above code defines a RegEx pattern. 
The pattern is: any five letter string starting with a 
and ending with s.

A pattern defined using RegEx can be used to match against a string. */

/*
Expression	        String	        Matched?
/^a...s$/	        abs	            No match
                    alias	        Match
                    abyss	        Match
                    Alias	        No match
                    An abacus	    No match 
*/

//============ Create a RegEx ===================
/*There are two ways you can create a regular expression in JavaScript.

1. Using a regular expression literal:
The regular expression consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes /. 
For example, */

const regularEXP1 = /abc/;

/*Here, /abc/ is a regular expression. */

/*
2. Using the RegExp() constructor function:
You can also create a regular expression 
by calling the RegExp() constructor function. 
For example, */

const regularEXP2 = new RegExp('abc');

//for example:

const regex = new RegExp(/^a...s$/);
console.log(regex.test('alias'));// Output: true

/*In the above example, 
the string alias matches with the RegEx pattern /^a...s$/. 
Here, the test() method is used to check if the string matches the pattern.

There are several other methods available to use with JavaScript RegEx. 
Before we explore them, let's learn about regular expressions themselves.

If you already know the basics of RegEx, 
jump to JavaScript RegEx Methods. */

//========= Specify Pattern Using RegEx ===========
/*To specify regular expressions, 
metacharacters are used. 
In the above example (/^a...s$/), ^ and $ are metacharacters.*/

//==MetaCharacters
/*

Metacharacters are characters that are interpreted in a special way 
by a RegEx engine. Here's a list of metacharacters:

[] . ^ $ * + ? {} () \ |

*/

//== [] - Square brackets
/*Square brackets specify a set of characters you wish to match.*/
/*
Expression	        String	        Matched?
[abc]	            a	            1 match
                    ac	            2 matches
                    Hey Jude	    No match
                    abc de ca	    5 matches
*/

/*Here, 
[abc] will match if the string you are trying to match contains 
any of the a, b or c.

You can also specify a range of characters using - inside square brackets.

[a-e] is the same as [abcde].

[1-4] is the same as [1234].

[0-39] is the same as [01239].

You can complement (invert) the character set 
by using caret ^ symbol at the start of a square-bracket.

[^abc] means any character except a or b or c.

[^0-9] means any non-digit character. */

//== . - Period

A period matches any single character (except newline '\n').

Expression	        String	        Matched?
..	                a	            No match
                    ac	            1 match
                    acd	            1 match
                    acde	        2 matches (contains 4 characters)

//== ^ - Caret

The caret symbol ^ is used to check if a string starts with a certain character.

Expression	        String	        Matched?
^a	                a	            1 match

a$	                a	            1 match
                    formula	        1 match
                    cab	            No match

//== * - Star

The star symbol * matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern left to it.

Expression	        String	        Matched?
ma*n	            mn	            1 match
                    man	            1 match
                    mann	        1 match
                    main	        No match (a is not followed by n)
                    woman	        1 match

//== + - Plus

The plus symbol + matches one or more occurrences of the pattern left to it.

Expression	        String	        Matched?
ma+n	            mn	            No match (no a character)
                    man	            1 match
                    mann	        1 match
                    main	        No match (a is not followed by n)
                    woman	        1 match

//== ? - Question Mark

The question mark symbol ? matches zero or one occurrence of the pattern left to it.

Expression	        String	    Matched?
ma?n	            mn	        1 match
                    man	        1 match
                    maan	    No match (more than one a character)
                    main	    No match (a is not followed by n)
                    woman	    1 match

//== {} - Braces

Consider this code: {n,m}. This means at least n, and at most m repetitions of the pattern left to it.

Expression	    String	    Matched?
a{2,3}	        abc dat	    No match
                abc daat	1 match (at daat)
                aabc daaat	2 matches (at aabc and daaat)
                aabc daaaat	2 matches (at aabc and daaaat)

Let's try one more example. This RegEx [0-9]{2, 4} matches at least 2 digits but not more than 4 digits.

Expression	        String	        Matched?
[0-9]{2,4}	        ab123csde	    1 match (match at ab123csde)
                    12 and 345673	3 matches (12, 3456, 73)
                    1 and 2	        No match

//== | - Alternation

Vertical bar | is used for alternation (or operator).

Expression	        String	    Matched?
a|b	                cde	        No match
                    ade	        1 match (match at ade)
                    acdbea	    3 matches (at acdbea)

Here, a|b match any string that contains either a or b

//== () - Group

Parentheses () is used to group sub-patterns. For example, (a|b|c)xz match any string that matches either a or b or c followed by xz

Expression	        String	    Matched?
(a|b|c)xz	        ab xz	    No match
                    abxz	    1 match (match at abxz)
                    axz cabxz	2 matches (at axzbc cabxz)

//== \ - Backslash

Backslash \ is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters. For example,

\$a match if a string contains $ followed by a. Here, $ is not interpreted by a RegEx engine in a special way.

If you are unsure if a character has special meaning or not, you can put \ in front of it. This makes sure the character is not treated in a special way.


//============= Special Sequences ===================
Special sequences make commonly used patterns easier to write. Here's a list of special sequences:

\A - Matches if the specified characters are at the start of a string.

Expression	        String	    Matched?
\Athe	            the sun	    Match
                    In the sun	No match

 	                            No match

\w - Matches any alphanumeric character (digits and alphabets). Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. By the way, underscore _ is also considered an alphanumeric character.

Expression	    String	    Matched?

JavaScript\Z	I like JavaScript	            1 match
                I like JavaScript Programming	No match
                JavaScript is fun	            No match
                
Tip: To build and test regular expressions, you can use RegEx tester tools such as regex101. This tool not only helps you in creating regular expressions, but it also helps you learn it.

Now you understand the basics of RegEx, let's discuss how to use RegEx in your JavaScript code.

//===== JavaScript Regular Expression Methods ============
/*As mentioned above, you can either use RegExp() or regular expression literal to create a RegEx in JavaScript.*/

const regex1 = /^ab/;
const regex2 = new Regexp('/^ab/');

/*In JavaScript, you can use regular expressions with RegExp() methods: test() and exec().

There are also some string methods that allow you to pass RegEx as its parameter. They are: match(), replace(), search(), and split().*/

Method	    Description
exec()	    Executes a search for a match in a string and returns an array of information. It returns null on a mismatch.
test()	    Tests for a match in a string and returns true or false.
match()	    Returns an array containing all the matches. It returns null on a mismatch.
matchAll()	Returns an iterator containing all of the matches.
search()	Tests for a match in a string and returns the index of the match. It returns -1 if the search fails.
replace()	Searches for a match in a string and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.
split()	    Break a string into an array of substrings.

//== Example 1: Regular Expressions
const string = 'Find me';
const pattern = /me/;

// search if the pattern is in string variable
const result1 = string.search(pattern);
console.log(result1); // 5

// replace the character with another character
const string1 = 'Find me';
string1.replace(pattern, 'found you'); // Find found you

// splitting strings into array elements
const regex1 = /[\s,]+/;
const result2 = 'Hello world! '.split(regex1);
console.log(result2); // ['Hello', 'world!', '']

// searching the phone number pattern
const regex2 = /(\d{3})\D(\d{3})-(\d{4})/g;
const result3 = regex2.exec('My phone number is: 555 123-4567.');
console.log(result3); // ["555 123-4567", "555", "123", "4567"]


//============== Regular Expression Flags =====================
Flags are used with regular expressions that allow various options such as global search, case-insensitive search, etc. They can be used separately or together.


/*Flags	Description
g	Performs a global match (find all matches)
m	Performs multiline match
i	Performs case-insensitive matching*/

//== Example 2: Regular Expression Modifier
const string = 'Hello hello hello';

// performing a replacement
const result1 = string.replace(/hello/, 'world');
console.log(result1); // Hello world hello

// performing global replacement
const result2 = string.replace(/hello/g, 'world');
console.log(result2); // Hello world world

// performing case-insensitive replacement
const result3 = string.replace(/hello/i, 'world');
console.log(result3); // world hello hello

// performing global case-insensitive replacement
const result4 = string.replace(/hello/gi, 'world');
console.log(result4); // world world world


//==Example 3: Validating the Phone Number
// program to validate the phone number

function validatePhone(num) {

    // regex pattern for phone number
    const re = /^\(?([0-9]{3})\)?[-. ]?([0-9]{3})[-. ]?([0-9]{4})$/g;

    // check if the phone number is valid
    let result = num.match(re);
    if (result) {
        console.log('The number is valid.');
    }
    else {
        let num = prompt('Enter number in XXX-XXX-XXXX format:');
        validatePhone(num);
    }
}

// take input
let number = prompt('Enter a number XXX-XXX-XXXX');

validatePhone(number);

Output

Enter a number XXX-XXX-XXXX: 2343223432
Enter number in XXX-XXX-XXXX format: 234-322-3432
The number is valid


//==Example 4: Validating the Email Address
// program to validate the email address

function validateEmail(email) {

    // regex pattern for email
    const re = /\S+@\S+\.\S+/g;

    // check if the email is valid
    let result = re.test(email);
    if (result) {
        console.log('The email is valid.');
    }
    else {
        let newEmail = prompt('Enter a valid email:');
        validateEmail(newEmail);
    }
}

// take input
let email = prompt('Enter an email: ');

validateEmail(email);

Output

Enter an email: hellohello
Enter a valid email: learningJS@gmail.com
The email is valid.
